map function optimisation
=========================

Level 2
=======

Our map function is supposed to be generic for any container. To verify this,
we will use it with an std::list object (question: what exactly is an std::list?).

Replace std::vector by std::list in your current code. What's happening?

The issue is that the "reserve" method does not exist for a container like
std::list. As we still want to keep the same interface for every container,
we'd really love to be able to call this method if and only if it exists.
