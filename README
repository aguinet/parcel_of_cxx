map function optimisation
=========================

Level 6 : parallelism
=====================

The loop we wrote on the previous level allows us to use the OpenMP
specification to easily parallelize our function.

Try to add this directive::

  #pragma omp parallel for

before the for-loop.

Compile your code and benchmark it. It is interesting to see what's going on with IDA :)

Run the benchmark twice in your code and see if there are any differences.
